# Jose Valadez Portfolio Readme

### Version 1.0

This web portfolio was created using **HTML,CSS** and 2 **Javascript** commands for Hamburguer menu as site is optimized for a variety of browsers, screens and devices.

## Navigation
The site can be navigates via mouse scrolling or keyboard.

> Bootsrap was not used for this project.

## Grid and Flex
These elements were used in order to continue and finish off practicing to create a dynamic site complemented by media queries.

The addition of Java required installing *Node.js*, *NPM*, *coderunner*, *Standard JS* and *Javascript ES6.* 

The tutorial to install and run Javascript comes from "Tech Decode Tutorial" https://youtu.be/x_2sYpk75Ic

Icons source was [Font_Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  using *Hamburguer*, *Facebook*, *Instagram* and *LinkedIn* **Free icons**
Font Source is [Google_Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) using licence free *Bebas Neue* for (H1 + Subtitle) and *Nanum Gothic* for the rest.

## Challenges

1. Installing of Java - Finding out that Java was required to develop a function to call a menu was a surprise, but ended with a good result. Now I can understand the basic concept of Java and even better I am ready for next term since its already installed.
2. Create side scrolling menu - seen it work many times but never understood how it worked until I watched youtube tutorials to build one on my own.
3. Find appropiate word array and size - Building copy for web sites is challenging and requires knowledge, which is not yet available easily (or freely) on the web. 
4. Media Query breakup points - I am still debacling if pixels or vh are the best breakup points for screen sizes. In this instance I continued using pixels to focus on newer subjects.

**Contribute** to this project and provide feedback to continue learning together.
